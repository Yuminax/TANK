# TANK

The "T.A.N.K" project, T.A.N.K And Napalm Kill, is a multiplayer LAN game on Unity that lets several players compete in 2D tank combat.
The game pits 2 teams of varying numbers of players against each other, each with their own tanks. In contrast to the turn-based combat genre, T.A.N.K allows each action to be chosen and executed simultaneously.
The game is divided into two phases: the preparation phase, in which each player chooses which action to take, and the combat phase, in which each action is executed.
A team wins when every opponent is destroyed.
